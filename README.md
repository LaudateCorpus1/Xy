Simulating Supervised Learning Data 
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/andrebleier/Xy.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/andrebleier/Xy)
===================================

With `Xy()` you can convienently simulate regression data. The simulation can be
very specific, since the user has many degrees of freedom. For instance,
the functional shape and hence the polynomial degree of nonlinearity can be
manipulated. Interaction can be formed and (co)variances altered. For a more specific
motivation you can visit our [blog](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/simulating-regression-data-with-xy/)

## Usage

The usage is pretty straight forward. I strongly encourage you to read the help document to explore all functionalities.

```
# get it from github
devtools::install_github("andrebleier/Xy")
# load the library
library(Xy)
# start hacking
my_simulation <- Xy()
```
