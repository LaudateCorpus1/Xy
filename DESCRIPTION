Description: A simulation framework for supervised learning
    data. The functionalities are specifically designed to let the user a
    maximum degrees of freedom, to ultimately fulfill the research
    purpose.  Furthermore, feature importances of the simulation can be
    created on a local and a global level.  This is particular
    interesting, for instance, to benchmark feature selection algorithms.
