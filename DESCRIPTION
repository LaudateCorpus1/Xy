Description: A simulation framework for supervised learning data. The functionalities are specifically
             designed to let the user a maximum degrees of freedom, to ultimately fulfill the research purpose.
             Furthermore, feature importances of the simulation can be created on a local and a global level. 
             This is particular interesting, for instance, to benchmark feature selection algorithms.
