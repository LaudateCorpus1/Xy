Version: 0.2
Authors@R: person("Andre", "Bleier", email = "andrebleier@live.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A simulation framework for supervised learning data. The functionalities are specifically
             designed to let the user a maximum degrees of freedom, to ultimately fulfill the research purpose.
             Furthermore, feature importances of the simulation can be created on a local and a global level. 
             This is particular interesting, for instance, to benchmark feature selection algorithms.
