Description: This package contains a convenient function to simulate supervised learning data. The function is specifically
             designed to let the user a maximum degrees of freedom, to ultimately fulfill the research purpose.
             Furthermore, feature importances of the simulation can be created on a local and a global level. 
             This is particular interesting, for instance, to benchmark feature selection algorithms.
Depends: R (>= 3.1), stats, data.table, Matrix, ggplot2
