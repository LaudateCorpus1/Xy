\title{Cook a simulation recipe of \code{\link[=Xy]{Xy()}}}
\usage{
simulate(
  object,
  n = 1000,
  r_squared = 0.8,
  cor_interval = c(-0.5, 0.5),
  cor_matrix = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{\link[=Xy]{xy_recipe}}.}

\item{n}{an integer specifying the desired number of obervations.}

\item{r_squared}{a numeric value between 0 and 1.}

\item{cor_interval}{a vector of length 2, which provides the correlation
sample interval for the correlation matrix.}

\item{cor_matrix}{a (positive semidefinite) correlation matrix.
This matrix inherits the desired correlation structure of
the simulated effects. Defaults to \code{NULL},
which means the structure will be sampled from \code{cor}}

\item{...}{additional parameters}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[=simulate]{xy_sim}}, which contains meta information about the
simulation. The user can manipulate this object with methods from
the class \code{\link[=simulate]{xy_sim}}, e.g. \code{\link[=importance]{importance()}}.
}
\description{
A function which simulates linear and nonlinear X and a corresponding
target. The composition of the target is highly customizable.
Furthermore, the polynomial degree as well as the functional shape of
nonlinearity can be specified by the user. Additionally coviarance structure
of the X can either be sampled by the function or specifically
determined by the user.
}
\details{
The simulation uses a copula backend and can simulate effects from
various distributions.
\itemize{
\item \code{r_squared}: The simulation adjusts the noise of the target generating
process according to the user specified input of the R^2.
Hence, if the user chooses to set a high R^2 then the noise
will have little to no effect on the target generating
process. Choosing lower R^2 yields to a stronger noise.
Thus, when fitting an ML model, the \code{r_squared} is the
upper bound of achievable adjusted r_squared.

# create a recipe
